This is my standard pipeline for aligning paired-end PRO-seq.
The two pipelines are the same aside from the slightly different
organization of the fastq files. The "BRC" pipeline matches the
format we get here at Cornell from our core facility, the Novogene
pipeline matches the format Novogene uses in their data releases
(at least as of a few months ago).
